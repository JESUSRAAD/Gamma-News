        When, while the lovely valley teems with vapour around me, and the
        meridian sun strikes the upper surface of the impenetrable foliage of my
        trees, and but a few stray gleams steal into the inner sanctuary, I
        throw myself down among the tall grass by the trickling stream; and, as
        I lie close to the earth, a thousand unknown plants are noticed by me:
        when I hear the buzz of the little world among the stalks, and grow
        familiar with the countless indescribable forms of the insects and
        flies, then I feel the presence of the Almighty, who formed us in his
        own image, and the breath of that universal love which bears and
        sustains us, as it floats around us in an eternity of bliss; and then,
        my friend, when darkness overspreads my eyes, and heaven and earth seem
        to dwell in my soul and absorb its power, like the form of a beloved
        mistress, then I often think with longing, Oh, would I could describe
        these conceptions, could impress upon paper all that is living so full
        and warm within me, that it might be the mirror of my soul, as my soul
        is the mirror of the infinite God!

        The sunset faded to twilight before anything further happened. The crowd
        far away on the left, towards Woking, seemed to grow, and I heard now a
        faint murmur from it. The little knot of people towards Chobham
        dispersed. There was scarcely an intimation of movement from the pit.<br /><br /><br /><br />
        Hermine hoping for courage. It was this, as much as anything, that gave
        people courage, and I suppose the new arrivals from Woking also helped
        to restore confidence. At any rate, as the dusk came on a slow,
        intermittent movement upon the sand pits began, a movement that seemed
        to gather force as the stillness of the evening about the cylinder
        remained unbroken. Vertical black figures in twos and threes would
        advance, stop, watch, and advance again, spreading out as they did so in
        a thin irregular crescent that promised to enclose the pit in its
        attenuated horns. I, too, on my side began to move towards the pit. Then
        I saw some cabmen and others had walked boldly into the sand pits, and
        heard the clatter of hoofs and the gride of wheels. I saw a lad
        trundling off the barrow of apples. And then, within thirty yards of the
        pit, advancing from the direction of Horsell, I noted a little black
        knot of men, the foremost of whom was waving a white flag.<br />

        Partially, but it also obeys your commands. Hey, Luke! May the Force be
        with you. I have traced the Rebel spies to her. Now she is my only link
        to finding their secret base. "This time, let go your conscious self and
        act on instinct." Leave that to me. Send a distress signal, and inform
        the Senate that all on board were killed.

        I should be incapable of drawing a single stroke at the present moment;
        and yet I feel that I never was a greater artist than now. When, while
        the lovely valley teems with vapour around me, and the meridian sun
        strikes the upper surface of the impenetrable foliage of my trees, and
        but a few stray gleams steal into the inner sanctuary, I throw myself
        down among the tall grass by the trickling stream; and, as I lie close
        to the earth, a thousand unknown plants are noticed by me: when I hear
        the buzz of the little world among the stalks, and grow familiar with
        the countless indescribable forms of the insects and flies, then I feel

        One morning, when Gregor Samsa woke from troubled dreams, he found
        himself transformed in his bed into a horrible vermin. He lay on his
        armour-like back, and if he lifted his head a little he could see his
        brown belly, slightly domed and divided by arches into stiff sections.
        The bedding was hardly able to cover it and seemed ready to slide off
        any moment. His many legs, pitifully thin compared with the size of the
        rest of him, waved about helplessly as he looked. "What's happened to
        me?" he thought. It wasn't a dream. His room, a proper human room
        although a little too small, lay peacefully between its four familiar
        walls. A collection of textile samples lay spread out on the table -
        Samsa was a travelling salesman - and above it there hung a picture that
        he had recently cut out of an illustrated magazine and housed in a nice,
        gilded frame. It showed a lady fitted out with a fur hat and fur boa who
        sat upright, raising a heavy fur muff that covered the whole of her
        lower arm towards the viewer. Gregor then turned to look out the window
        at the dull weather

        This time, let go your conscious self and act on instinct. In my
        experience, there is no such thing as luck. You're all clear, kid. Let's
        blow this thing and go home! You don't believe in the Force, do you?
        Partially, but it also obeys your commands. The plans you refer to will
        soon be back in our hands. As you wish.
